        <p>The Miami Hurriane (<abbr title="The Miami Hurricane">TMH</abbr>) is the official student newspaper of the University of Miami and was founded in <time datetime="1929">1929</time>. </p>

        <p>While the newspaper was widely circulated in the past, the emergence of the digital age and the coronavirus pandemic has created an emphasis on online journalism within the organization.</p>

        <p>Now, TMH publishes the majority of their content on their website and on their digital newsletters.</p>

        <p>However, in the Fall <time datetime="2020">2020</time> semester, the newspaper did distribute a print edition themed after the presidential election. These special edition newspapers are likely to be printed more in the future as less standard issues are released.</p>

        <p>The paper spans their journalistic coverage across a variety of sections, including news, opinion, culture and sports.</p>

          <h3>MY INVOLVEMENT</h3>

          <p>I joined The Miami Hurricane in my freshman fall semester as a reporter for both the sports and news teams. Coming into college, I knew I wanted to be a part of the newspaper staff given how much I enjoyed and grew from my time with CavsConnect during high school.</p>

          <p>After a year of writing with the paper, I have enjoyed the experience just as much, and I have published over 25 articles combined across the two sections.</p>
