          <h3>MY INVOLVEMENT</h3>
          <p>During my freshman orientation, I was first exposed to Category 5 through a virtual presentation on student organizations. As soon as I learned what it was all about, I applied immediately.</p>

          <p>The energy and spirit that characterizes Category 5 really appealed to me, and as somebody that wants to work in sports media in the future, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn some sports marketing skills and improve my photography and videography techniques.</p>

          <p>Shortly after applications were due, I was accepted into the Category 5 Council under the Creative Services Committee and was assigned to the Photo / Video team.</p>

          <p>Throughout my first year on Council, I attended numerous spirit events themed after the various sports offered at the University of Miami, including football, basketball and baseball. At each of these, I took photos and videos that were then published on the Category 5 Instagram and Facebook pages! </p>

          <h3>UP NEXT</h3>

          <p>In the upcoming semester, I will be holding a new position within Category 5 as I look to further my involvement with the organization. After a year on the Category 5 Council, I have received the role of Creative Services Director on the Executive Board.</p>
