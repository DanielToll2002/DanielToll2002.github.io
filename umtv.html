        <p><abbr title="University of Miami Television">UMTV</abbr> is the University of Miami's award-winning television station housed in the School of Communication on the Coral Gables campus.</p>

        <p>While the programs are guided by faculty advisors, the station is fully student-run in every aspect of production and the delivery of content on-camera.</p>

        <p>UMTV features a wide variety of programming that is aired in the Coral Gables area and streamed online. The organization consists of eight unique shows that appeal to different interests of the student body. These include CanesCast, The Culture, NewsBreak, NewsVision, Off the Wire, Pulse, SportsDesk and UniMiami.</p>

        <p>Each show consists of their own sets of producers and cast members, and each show airs on different days and at different times throughout the week.</p>

        <p>Of the eight shows, six are recorded and two - NewsVision and SportsDesk - are live. However, while SportsDesk is aired live, much of the content on the show is pre-recorded. NewsVision, on the other hand, is entirely live from start to finish.</p>

          <h3>MY INVOLVEMENT</h3>

          <p>I began my involvement with UMTV in my freshman fall semester, when I joined SportsDesk: UMTV's half-hour sports news show.</p>

          <p>While I was not casted for an on-camera role, I joined the production crew. Since I entered the organization with no prior knowledge or experience in broadcast journalism, I mostly did small tasks early on, like working a camera or scrolling a teleprompter during the pre-recording of segments that would be aired on the live show.</p>

          <p>As time went on, I began helping with the production of the weekly social media segment, which is published on Instagram prior to every show and gives SportsDesk's audience a brief rundown of what will be covered during the live show.</p>

          <p>Eventually, I was given full ownership of the segment's production, which allowed me to continue developing my video-editing skills on Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

        <article class="umtv-involvement">
          <p>In my second semester, I remained on the production crew for SportsDesk, but also auditioned for an on-camera role on NewsVision: UMTV's half-hour news show, which covers, local news, sports and the weather. Shortly after my audition, I was casted as a Sports Reporter, giving me my first chance to be on camera with UMTV.</p>

          <p>Throughout the semester, I conducted two on-the-scene live shots in front of the Watsco Center, put together three <abbr title="Voiceover / Sound-on-tape">VO/SOTs</abbr> and produced my first package ever! I also had the opportunity to front and tag my story, which was an exhilirating experience.</p>

          <p>Below is a video of me presenting and delivering my story on the <time datetime="2021-03-25">March 25</time> episode of NewsVision!</p>

          <h3>UP NEXT</h3>

          <p>As I look to continue my involvement with UMTV, I also look to advance in the positions that I have previously held.</p>

          <p>In the upcoming semester, I will be one of SportsDesk's two Executive Producers, and with NewsVision, I look to audition for their cast once again and hopefully work my way up to the Sports Anchor position.</p>

          <p>Within the organization, I will also be joining the Executive Board as Outreach Coordinator, which will give me the opportunity to manage the UMTV Mentorship Program and facilitate the assimilation and recruitment process for students interested in being involved with the station.</p>
