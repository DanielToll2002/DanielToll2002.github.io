        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In <time datetime="1830-02">1830</time>, Greece claimed its independence from the Ottoman Empire. Throughout much of the late 19th century and the early 20th century, Greece added numerous islands and territories to the continental country. Most of these included Greek-speaking populations. </p>

        <p>Throughout World War II, Greece was invaded by Italy and ultimately occupied by Germany from <time datetime="1941-04">1941</time> through <time datetime="1944-06">1944 </time>. During this time, fighting continued in the area amidst a civil war that consisted of supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels.</p>

        <p>After the war in <time datetime="1952-10-22">1952</time>, Greece joined <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"><a href="https://www.nato.int/">NATO</a></abbr>. A military dictatorship was then established in <time datetime="1967-04-21">1967</time> that halted the political liberties of the citizenry and forced the king to escape the country. The dictatorship collapsed in <time datetime="1974-12-08">1974</time> and democratic elections abolished the monarchy. The newly formulated parliamentary republic still stands to this day. Greece joined what is now referred to as the <abbr title="European Union"><a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">EU</a></abbr> in <time datetime="1981">1981</time>, and became the 12th member of the <abbr title="European Economic and Monetary Union"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-and-monetary-union_en">EMU</a></abbr> <time datetime="2001">twenty years later.</time></p>
