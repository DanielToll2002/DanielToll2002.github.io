          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

          <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website, where the best of my articles, photos and videos will be housed! Throughout my time in college, I will be frequently updating this site with my mutlimedia content as I create it.</p>

          <p>I intend to use this platform as a method of documenting my progress over time, and I hope that along the way I will be able to see personal growth and development.</p>

          <p>Before getting into my experiences in the fascinating world of journalism, here is a little bit about me:</p>

          <p>I am a rising sophomore at the University of Miami majoring in Broadcast Journalism with minors in Sport Administration and Electronic Media. Within the School of Communication - which encompasses Broadcast Journalism - I am part of the Class of 2024 Honors Program as well as the university-wide Foote Fellows Honors Program.</p>

          <p>As a lifelong Miamian and big-time sports fan, the Miami Marlins and the Miami Heat will always have a special place in my heart. In the future, I hope to work for either of my hometown teams in any capacity as part of the ever-evolving media industry.<p>

          <h3 class="my-why-text">MY "WHY"</h3>
          <p>I feel extremely fortunate to do what I love and love what I do every single day as a Broadcast Journalism student at <abbr title="University of Miami">UM</abbr>, and that's what constantly motivates me to learn something new, search for something new to learn, and to improve my skills on a daily basis.

          <p>Coming into college, I came in knowing so little, but I have learned so much since then. However, there is still a long road ahead for me to continue learning and developing myself as a professional, and I am grateful to say that I cannot wait for every moment of it.</p>
