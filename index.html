          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

          <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website, where the best of my articles, photos and videos will be housed! Throughout my time in college, I will be frequently updating this site with my mutlimedia content as I create it.</p>

          <p>I intend to use this platform as a method of documenting my progress over time, and I hope that along the way I will be able to see personal growth and development.</p>

          <p>Before getting into my experiences in the fascinating world of journalism, here is a little bit about me:</p>

          <p>I am a rising sophomore at the University of Miami majoring in Broadcast Journalism with minors in Sport Administration and Electronic Media. Within the School of Communication - which encompasses Broadcast Journalism - I am part of the Class of 2024 Honors Program as well as the university-wide Foote Fellows Honors Program.</p>

          <p>As a lifelong Miamian and big-time sports fan, the Miami Marlins and the Miami Heat will always have a special place in my heart. I have followed these teams since my childhood, and in the future, I hope to work for either of my hometown teams in any capacity as part of the ever-evolving media industry.<p>

      <section id="my-why">
          <h3 class="my-why-text">MY "WHY"</h3>
          <p>I feel extremely fortunate to do what I love and love what I do every single day as a Broadcast Journalism student at <abbr title="University of Miami">UM</abbr>, and that's what constantly motivates me to learn something new, search for something new to learn, and to improve my skills on a daily basis.

          <p>Coming into college, I came in knowing so little, but I have learned so much since then. However, there is still a long road ahead for me to continue learning and developing myself as a professional, and I am grateful to say that I cannot wait for every moment of it.</p>

          <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
          <ul class="fun-facts-list">
            <li>I have two amazing golden doodles, Lilly and Chloe, who are the greatest pals.</li>
            <li>As a sports fan, the best year of my life was 2017. That year, I attended the World Baseball Classic, the <abbr title="Major League Baseball">MLB</abbr> All-Star Game and the MLB Home Run Derby.</li>
            <li>My favorite snack is chips and guacamole, and I order it every time I go to a restaurant. One day, I hope to discover the best chips and guacamole order in all of Miami!</li>
            <li>Despite being frequently active in sports and exercise as a kid, I've never broken a bone. However, I did take a fastball to the elbow in my freshman year of high school that might have broken <em>something</em>, but I never had it checked out since it healed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I attended middle school, high school, and am currently attending college in The City Beautiful: Coral Gables, Florida.</li>

            <h4>#1 Bucket List Adventure</h4>

            <p>Baseball has always been my personal favorite sport. It is rooted deep in my family heritage, and I played the game for 10 years. As I look to involve myself with the world of sports in the future, one of my biggest goals and dreams is to be able to travel the country, tour every single Major League Baseball stadium and collect a cap from each park as a souvenir.<p>
